# Mobile-Banking

1. In this project we are going to develop a hybrid mobile application which will run on both Android and IOS mobile platform. The mobile application involves the banking features like viewing the transaction details along with the push notification for the transaction, transferring money to other account holder and can view the nearby ATMs.

2. We had a banking portal also using flutter, which will provide the functionality like creating bank account, depositing money, withdrawing money, viewing all users, searching for a particular user.

3. To register for net banking, user must first have to open bank account on the portal. After creating account on the portal then the user can register himself for the net banking on the mBank.

4. Both the application Banking portal and net banking can be run on iOS as well as android. This hybrid development reduced the cost of developing two applications separately and also minimizes the testing and maintenance cost.

5. It includes various functionalities such as perfect UI interactions, orderly display of transaction, view of current balance, view of nearby ATM and push notification.
